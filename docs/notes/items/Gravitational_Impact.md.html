<p>In the pursuit of a <span class="math inline">\(\underline{workable}\)</span> platform to simulate an approximate universe, obviusly a very large endevor, I seek to understand and condense the interactions between bodies in space, and forumalte it to a set of functions and variables to represent any encounter between two bodies in space.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>the very, very, basics</strong></p>
<p>Actually <em>accurately</em> simulating the entire universe is a foolish task. All bodies of some mass have impact on the movements of the others. While discounting this below a certain threshold; ex. <span class="math inline">\(x : \{x \nless \lfloor t - z\rfloor \}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is some force, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is some threshold, and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is gravitational force of some body, might be worthwhile, eventually the small differences would create a slip.</p>
<p>How then, to account for this slip? I have no idea.</p>
<p>One way to account for this would be taking the greastest of set <span class="math inline">\(Nx\)</span>, where <span class="math display">\[e : Nx \implies e : \begin{cases} e \notin x\\ e \exists! \in Nx \\e = max\{Nx\} \end{cases}\]</span> and including <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> in each subsequent calculation. This however, just pushes the slip one level down; thereâ€™s now a slip in threshold each calculation and no real improvement of the situation.</p>
