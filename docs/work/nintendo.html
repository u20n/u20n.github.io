<h2>Nintendo -- Art and Morals</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Nintendo is the the forbidden fruit of art. A company which has a lengthily record of malignant intent directly towards its consumers, but also produces some of the most beautiful and well regarded games of the modern era. The impact of intention begetting knowledge is certainly an old question; it is literally biblical.
</p>

<p>
In the Book of Genesis, God forbids Adam and Eve from eating the apple from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil -- they do not comply, and under the reasonable presumption of Jehovah, that they will eat next from the Tree of Life, they are expelled. This fork of decision; to eat or not to eat, forms the basis of the two traditions -- (religious) morality, and that of humanism. Underlying both are common morals; as Kurtz writes in Toward A New Enlightenment, "[the morals] express the elementary virtues of courtesy, politeness, and empathy so essential for living together; indeed, they are the very basis of civilized life itself" (Kurtz, 26). The former is tradition judged by wisdom; intelligence handed down from eons of human thought. The latter is the adaptation of the former to the present and future. Effective ethics is necessarily an amalgamation of the two.

The story of the Trees of Knowledge and Life is binary. If Adam and Eve were not to eat from the tree, how could they know Good and Evil? How could they know God is Good? The story of the Trees of Knowledge and Life gives the responsibility for evaluation of the metaphysical to humanity. As Oderberg describes in The Metaphysics of Good and Evil, "Our world is essentially and fundamentally a world of act and potency" (Oderberg, 42). Upon this plane, the recursive states of potency; that which could be, and of act; that which is -- are the only definitions axiomatic to Good and Evil. Things are defined intrinsically; "[the] essence of an existing object is itself an actuality" (Oderberg, 48). Things only must act in a way proper to their nature, and in a way which is not opposite to that nature. Good is the default state of things. So how to evaluate a thing which is Good according to its nature, but whose accordance is in opposition to its potential?

<p>
The games produced by Nintendo are works of art -- devoid of anything but craftsmanship and appreciation for true beauty. It is the reputation on which all existing Nintendo games have been staked upon. This is the same reputation which has a dual history of vicious prosecution of virtuous fan content and their creators (almost entirely produced as a result of absence of an official entity). How cruel is fate; that Nintendo's games Good, and Nintendo Evil? Now, many are faced with a choice -- which tradition to adopt. I for one, forsake the Trees of Knowledge and Life; how could beauty exist as the product of Evil, if it were truly beauty?

<b>Post Script:</b>
I'd HIGHLY recommend a full read of Oderberg's work -- it is incredibly lucid, and of course valuable.
