      <p>Voting is important; not to 'win', but rather for the participation in the process. Voting as honest participation in the process is henceforth referred to as 'positive' voting, while voting to intentionally deadlock legislation or candidacy for office is henceforth referred to as 'negative' voting.</p>
      <p>Majoritarian electoral systems corrupt the meaning of voting through 2 major processes:</p>
      <ol type=1>
        <li>The consolidation of voters</li>
        <li>The reinforcement of 'negative' voting</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These form a series of run-off processes, which serve to further reinforce the two major processes.</p> 
      <p>In no particular order:</p>
      <ol type=a>
        <li>The precipitation of policy and identity ambiguity</li>
        <li>Legislative deadlock in systems with delayed terms</li>
        <li>The loss of the moderates</li>
        <li>The normalisation of advocacy for extreme policy</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Big parties formed via the consolidation of voters through 'negative' voting are incentivised to cater to the extremes of their general alignment; these extreme voters recursively inspire the 'negative' voting moderates opposite to their alignment, and 'positively' vote, thus forming the crucial margin for large parties. Extreme policy is thus advocated to attract these extreme voters, and the moderates are relegated to the infinite loop of 'negative' voting.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The solution? Vote positively.</p>
