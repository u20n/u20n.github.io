Those attracted to alternative platforms
========================================

My views regarding platforms has already been documented[0], but the people who are attracted to these alternative platforms are sometimes awful.

People who are banned off of major platforms are usually;
a) vocal
b) not fully ... lucid
c) aggressive

These major platforms aren't incentivised to kick off every person who may have a gripe with their existence; how would they make money? It's the truly disruptive and irreformable people who are forcibly removed. These people are bad for everything; bad for advertisers, bad for users (children to adults), and bad for the dynamic of the site. Only alternative platforms which have varying levels of acceptance (between impartial or welcoming) are suitable places for these transients.

I use odysee for my RSS feeds of channels, to avoid youtube when possible. The people who comment on that site are generally the most detached from reality that I've ever seen, even on certain infamous image boards. As a product of their existence, most of the 'special' commenters are a delightful blend of antisemitism, anti-vaxx, fascist, and insurrectionist.

People like this should just be left alone, or given some form of help. I just wish I didn't have to see their posts.
