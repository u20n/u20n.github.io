Books should not be banned
==========================

The state of Florida has engaged in overtly Orwellian legislation which has provided a legal framework for citizens to outright ban books in schools[0].
This is deeply troubling, but is unfortunately indicitive of a larger trend of proud stupidity.
      
Emotional thinking has become acceptable justifiaction for the parties of the United States. It justifies the loop of 'negative' voting[1], and provides the uneducated a base on which they feel comfortable. The uneducated will thus look to further reinforce their anchor of fear. The entirely draconian measure of banning books, which as excepted[2], is osetensibly done "for the children", is a means to an end. It substitutes reasonable discourse for emotional and personal opinion. The uneducated, having found a basis for their emotional opinions which they knowingly cannot justify sine rectus pretense, will attempt to restrict all other. Instead of having a constructive interpretation to challenges to their views, they emotionally react; drawing upon unchallengable pretense to justify their views; even substituting predicate logic as argument for pretense as argument. At which point, challenging their views is akin to challenging their pretenses, whether that be on religion, politics, or the nature of the universe. Only an one who is either an imbecile or malicous would do something so abhorrent.
