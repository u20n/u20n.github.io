Genology in Desolation

Each specimen has been honed into the best iteration of their own local extrema, in both enivronment and genology.

There is also something alluring about the challenge of desolation; it is the truest form of examination -- the highest stakes of nature. To lose is to fail the process of evolution, to win is both the sucession of the future genome, and the justification for its current iteration. Elegantly, desolation is the levelest playing field of evolution; it is the most barren and honest plain (+/plane) on which to judge life.

Certainly, the overt complexity of more bountiful environments isn't a disqualification for their respective inhabitants; one can appreciate the lean, mean form of the cat as much as the streamlined elegance of the penguin. The deserts of the world are instead the most bare (barren) of all, and their inhabitants are nessecariliy the most effective, the most streamlined. Environmental complexity is much more naunced, and the number of inhabitants significantly reduced. This would lead one to beilive that this fascination is caused by the simplicity of evaluation -- it is much harder to comprehend why a jungle creature has evolved into its niche because of the complexity of its environment.
