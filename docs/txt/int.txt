Intelligence (ew)
=================

Intelligence is a moot point. If it is an absolute attribute, one could only 'evaluate' up until their own intelligence; anything beyond is beyond their intelligence +/ understanding.

Additionally, the evaluation of intelligence is more often, ceteris paribus, an issue of communication. People on the autistic spectrum or those with ADH/D will have trouble focusing on some 'thing' they don't find, for lack of a better word, interesting. Converse about that 'thing', and their aptitude drastically increases. Does this mean autistic people, or those with ADH/D are less intelligent? No.

This is a very intrinsic concept to the human experience -- exempli gratis;
a) higher/lower order beings
b) 'normal' language barriers
c) different means of communication; sonar, etc.

A) Intelligence is a fluid and redundant concept
B) Even if intelligence was worthwhile, it's really hard to evaluate, meaning (A)
