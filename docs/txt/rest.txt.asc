A Day of Rest

You need not be religious to subscribe to a day of rest. A whole day of rest is incredibly beneficial in the typical 5-6 day workweek.
- - A whole day of rest is concentrated, and thus is more effective than incremental periods of rest during work days.
- - A consistent whole day of rest builds more typical work patterns.
