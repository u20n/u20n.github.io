S/FTP -- The final frontier
=========================
S/FTP[0] is the best option for all file transfer operations. (anything but HTTP)

Generally, 'websites' should be done as a PASV (duh), anonymous or login-less read only FTP servers. The core benefit[1] of S/FTP is that configuration is fairly arbitrary, and so I provide the above only as a suggestion.

[0]: Note here that S/FTP refers to FTP and FTP via SSH.
[1]: Not including the brevity and simplicity of the protocol.
