Magic ought to be free
======================

Discussions of intellectual property[0] and the commons eventually all circle back to the question of freedom. It is unfortunate that the immediate assumption of freedom is as gratis, rather than libre. In certain cases, intellectual property can be free as in libre, but not as in gratis. One example being that of academic papers; generally when published, the reader must subscribe to the relevant journal to obtain the paper[1]. The reader is free to use and interpret that work in however perse sees fit, but initial access is not gratis.

This, we argue, should be the extent of strictly non-free intellectual property. At no point should intellectual property be non-libre. In the case of commercial, academic, or administrative works, access should be given freely and without restriction. The linchpin is the criteria for consideration; if an intellectual property is distributed for consumption, then it meets the criteria. This exempts personal work, including certain private research or unpublished works.

In the domain of software, this rule is crucial. The power wielded by humans via software and automation is magic incarnate. It is also a core part of our modern society; too much relies upon it not to be free. Banking, medicine, agriculture, airplanes, buses, trains, ships -- these are all dependent to some degree on software. We observe the recent debacle with John Deere v Farmers, where million dollar farm equipment locks its owner out via software, leading to a increase of jail-broken and pirated tractors[2]. We (the 'free' world) govern according to the ideals of a democratic republic; we ostensibly do not allow a centralised private power to rule our governance -- why would a domain so crucial to the same society be different?
