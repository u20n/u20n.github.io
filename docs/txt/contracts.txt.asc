Nations as social contracts
===========================

Foreword: This is a consolidation of a series of converstations with a close friend, regarding the exact formulation of a nation in view of its participants. General statements, such as "come of age" are intentionally vauge, so as not to needlessly restrict the analysis via cultural differences between individual nations.

Nations can be formulated as social contracts implemented onto Natural Law. Inate citizenship of nations is given by birth within the nation's domain; otherwise ignoring explictly consensual citizenship. This is a function of the parents' endorsement of the nation's social contract, which can be refuted when the individual has come of age. The nation functions as a social contract wherin citizens affect its will via force, engage in it via their acceptance of the contract, and in some cases, govern it as a consequent of their contract. In this sense, the social contract is a voluntary extension of Natural Law.
