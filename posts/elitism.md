## Preamble
Elitism is inherently a negative trait. I'd argue that the right type[^types] of elitism in software is beneficial to the code base, the users[^novice], and to the field itself.

## Bloat is bad. 
Are the users bloat? Accommodating for all often leads to concessions for many; this is unescapable in the material world[^2me], but it can be completely avoided in the virtual. By **encouraging** the users of the software to acclimate themselves with the *actual* software, they are more inclined to fix/tinker/customise their **local** copies to best suit their needs. Should they be inclined, they of course can share these modifications with others. This is the ideal[^2me] ecosystem for a piece of (assumed OSS) software.

## I don't have the time
... is a common refrain (citation needed). This is fair; and why software should have good documentation. Users, completely devoid of contact with the maintainers or any actual people, should be able to solve *most* problems or questions they encounter/have using documented and searchable[^search] resources. In this respect, the type of elitism matters; arrogance will result in shoddy or unhelpful documentation, as the maintainers will assume base knowledge that the user does not have. Similarly, a 'hands off' approach; wherein the maintainers **don't** write documentation and thus require users to search the source code, kills new user integration (and eventually the software).

## Existing Structures
Chief among these 'ideal' elitist groups is of course [suckless](https://suckless.org). As members of the field, the focus on reducing unnecessary complexity (+/ bloat) is something that all should strive to achieve. Computer literacy will not (truly) increase unless we stop abstracting core concepts and operations from the end user[^2me]. **Small tasks should be done in small, singular programs**. In contrast, corporate software is unabashedly horrible. As a permutation of corporate software, Windows is also horrible. Things breaking on a linux/unix system are often scary, but able to be traced, and (eventually :^) ) fixed. 

Windows gives you a blue screen, and a sorry message. 

You don't know why something broke (unless you look up the code they give you on your phone, or another computer). Ironically, this doesn't even matter, because your control of the operating system is so abstracted that you couldn't (easily) fix it if you wanted to.

### Footnotes
[^types]: Arrogance is a part of, but not exclusively, elitism. This distinction is important; I consider the 'good' type of elitism as the complete dedication to the art of engineering, rather than to the software's users.
[^novice]: Somewhat paradoxically, the users of elitist software tend to be the developers or those familiar with its development (Citation Needed). Novice users are encouraged to RT(F)M, and so become part of the 'in' group.
[^2me]: According to me. (But come on...)
[^search]: This is slightly hypocritical; answer sites tend to function almost exactly as mailing lists, etc. However, as archives of previous questions, I consider these distinct forms of documentation.
