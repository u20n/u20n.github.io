Introduction & Origins:

Ocean Literacy: "The awareness and understanding of fundamental concepts about the history, functioning, contents, and utilization of the ocean"
Explanation: fundamental understanding of the ocean, what is in the ocean, what bio is in the ocean and their importance, and ocean resources
- Recognize the influence of the ocean on daily life
- Communicates meaningfully about the Ocean
- Make informed, responsible decisions about the ocean and its resources
- Understand the science behind the ocean
- Ask critical questions

Ocean's roles:
- Central role in life on Earth
- Moderates global temperature (Allowing for life as we know it)
- Influences weather and climate
- 1/2 of petroleum and natural gas
- Nearly half of the world's population live near coasts (defined as within 150 miles of the shore)
- Nurtures immense diversity of life (Life probably originated in the ocean)

The World Ocean: "The vast body of saline water that occupies the depressions of earth's surface"
All oceans are interconnected;
  - Avrg depth: 2.4 miles (3.8k m)
  - Volume: 329 million cubic miles
  - Tallest mountain on earth: Mauna Kea, 6.3 miles
  - Deepest spot: Challenger Deep, 6.8 miles
  - Age: About 4 billion years

However, the world ocean is often divided into 5 oceans;
- Pacific
  - World's largest and deepest ocean
- Arctic
  - Smallest and shallowest ocean
- Atlantic
  - Second-largest ocean
  - Youngest ocean (180 million years ago)
- Southern
  - Defined by Antarctic Convergence & surrounds Antarctica
- Indian
  - Exists mostly in the Southern Hemisphere

Most of our planets water is seawater;
- 97.2% is seawater
- 0.016% is readily accessible freshwater (Lakes and streams)
- 2.15% is not readily available freshwater (Glaciers)
- 0.63% is ground water (Accessed via wells for use)

Oceanography is a new science
- "Process of discovering unifying principles of the ocean"
- mostly concerning;
  - Origin and formation of the oceans
  - Nature of life forms it nurtures now, and in the past
  - How it impacts the earth's climate and biosphere
- Collecting data
- Science defined as;
  - Systematic process of asking questions about the observable world and then testing the answers
