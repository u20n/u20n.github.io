              <mark> Passage is referenced from Ms. Armstrong's 2009 book, <i>The Case for God</i> </mark>
              <br /><br />
              Armstrong argues that the writings of <mark>New Atheists</mark> (Richard Dawkins, Daniel C. Dennett, Sam Harris, Victor J. Stenger, Christopher Hitchens) are themselves influenced by the fundamentalism that they reject.
              <br /><br />
              Dawkins states that all religion is based on "a superhuman, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it"
              <br />
              Armstrong instead argues that the earlier interpretation of <mark>religion was as a mythos, meant to alter our understanding of the world and our place in it</mark>, likening it to poetry.
              <br /><br />
              Poetry is created by the poet as their unconscious, "... slowly calling up a poem word by word, phrase by phrase, until something beautiful is brought forth ...", with the goal of changing how people interpret the world around them, and themselves

              Physical location is <mark>Lascaux in the Dordogne</mark> (Underground Caverns)
              <br />
              Incredible darkness in the Lascaux causes "timeless ceilingdissociation from every concern and requirement of the upper world that you have left behind"
              <br />
              All orientation is gone, direction is lost
              <br />
              eg. it's like stepping into another, completely seperate dimension
              <br /><br />
              First discovered by Palaeolithic ancestors in the Stone Age (1700 yrs ago)
              <br />
              First cavern is 65ft below ground level, adorned with a cave painting on the ceiling;
              <br />
              <mark>"A strange beast with gravid belly and long pointed horns walks behind a line of wild cattle, horses, deer, and bulls that seem simultaneously in motion and at rest"</mark>
              <br /><hr />
              <mark>~600 frescoes, 1500 engravings</mark> in the Lascaux
              <br />
              <b>frescoes</b>: "<u>a painting done rapidly in watercolor on wet plaster on a wall or ceiling, so that the colors penetrate the plaster and become fixed as it dries</u>"
              <br /><br />
              Some examples of frescoes in the Lascaux;
              <ul>
                <li>powerful bellowing black stag</li>
                <li>leaping cow</li>
                <li>procession of horses</li>
                <li>frieze of elegant deer</li>
              </ul>
              The Palaeolithic artists often painted over old paintings, implying that location was important, although the rationale for the locations is unknown.
              <br />
              The rationale in the selection of subjects is also unknown;
              <ul>
                <li>Only a few of known species are painted, most interestingly is the exclusion of the reindeers that they relied on for sustenance</li>
                <li>Animals are paired in combinations that would occur in the wild</li>
              </ul>
              <mark>300 marked caves are in the area (Southern France and northern Spain), seperate from Lascaux, which have approximately the same layout and content</mark>
              <br /><br />
              The earlist site is <mark>Grotte Chauvet, from ~30,000 BCE</mark>
              <br />
              Grotte Chauvet aligned with an "abrupt evolutionary change in this locality"; dramatic increase in population, resulting in possible social tension</li>
              <br /><br />
              <b><mark> The caves serve as the earliest known evidence of an ideological system, which remained in place for ~20,000 years, falling into disuse ~900 BCE</mark></b>
