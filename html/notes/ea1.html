              <mark> Passage is referenced from Ms. Armstrong's 2009 book, <i>The Case for God</i> </mark>
              <br /><br />
              Armstrong argues that the writings of <mark>New Atheists</mark> (Richard Dawkins, Daniel C. Dennett, Sam Harris, Victor J. Stenger, Christopher Hitchens) are themselves influenced by the fundamentalism that they reject.
              <br /><br />
              Dawkins states that all religion is based on "a superhuman, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it"
              <br />
              Armstrong instead argues that the earlier interpretation of religion was as a mythos, meant to alter our understanding of the world and our place in it, likening it to poetry.
              <br /><br />
              Poetry is created by the poet as their unconscious, "... slowly calling up a poem word by word, phrase by phrase, until something beautiful is brought forth ...", with the goal of changing how people interpret the world around them, and themselves
